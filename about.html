                    <b> mel </b> was born out of the lived experiences of our owners, 
                    having worked both in-house and agency side. 
                    They had found that the traditional digital marketing agency setup,
                    where creative and media were separated, 
                    was no longer suitable for direct to consumer brands
                    in the new age of advertising.
                </div>
                
                <div class="about-us-first-text-part-two">
                    We see the new age of advertising as a world in which creative 
                    and media are so intrinsically linked and intertwined, 
                    that they simply cannot live apart anymore. 
                    Great brands are consistent in how they look and sound, 
                    cohesive in their strategies and clearly aligned in their goals. 
                    We have experienced first-hand how difficult it is to become
                    a great brand in the traditional agency world,
                    so we created <b> mel </b> to fix that.

                <div class="about-us-second-text-part-one">
                    Through our lived experiences of the problems brands face when they detach media and creative, 
                    our solution was simple, to put both of them together, all under-one-roof. 
                    Half of our agency is made up of a full in-house creative team; 
                    working across videography, photography, post-production, motion graphics, 
                    graphic design and branding. The other half is a media department, 
                    working across an array of channels in the field of paid social, 
                    PPC, email marketing, programmatic, organic social, out-of-home 
                    and influencer marketing.
                </div>

                <div class="about-us-second-text-part-two">
                    The benefits of our all under-one-roof approach are numerous, 
                    but our partners most notably express their preference of the cohesiveness 
                    and alignment of our strategies, our tight, data-driven feedback loops 
                    and the economy of scale that comes with having 1 agency partner instead of 2 or more.

                    We are proud to have a young and talented team of digital 
                    and creative specialists at <b> mel</b>. They are all highly experienced 
                    in the platforms that we operate on, but crucially, 
                    they are also first mover and early adopters of new platforms. 
                    They have their fingers firmly on the pulse and regularly propose new channels 
                    and opportunities for our clients.

                <div class="about-us-third-text-part-two">
                    At <b>mel</b>, we take a platform agnostic approach to the strategies 
                    that we develop for our partners. Our extensive experience working across multiple sectors, 
                    as well as careful analysis of potential new opportunities informs our decision making. 
                    All too often traditional platforms are relied upon regardless of the appropriateness of them for each business.
